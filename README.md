# Module 7 Challenge
 
# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis for the previous deliverables was to get the following information:

    Retrieve the employees at Pewlett Hackard that were born between January 1st 1952 and December 31st 1955 in order to get an account of all employees that are eligible for retirement. We then filtered through duplicates and employees that had previously left and got the employee titles. Then, we retrieved a count of employees that are about to retire and grouped them by their title in order to get an idea of what positions will soon be vacant.

    In the second delivery, we retrieved the information of the employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorhip program. We did this by joining 3 tables together by their employee number and filtering the employees by current employees that were born between January 1st 1965 and December 31st 1965.

# Results

The results of the analysis are as follows:

    There are currently 72,458 employees eligible for retirement when you filter out duplicates and employees who have already left.
    Of the employees eligible for retirement, senior engineer has the highest count at 25,916 employees.
    Manager has the lowest count at just 2.
    There are currently 1,549 employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

# Summary

This summary helps address two main questions:

    How many of our employees are eligible to retire? and what are their positions?
    How many of our employees are eligible for a mentorship program?

In total, as the "silver tsunami" makes its impact, 72,458 positions will need to be filled. Yes there are enough retirement ready employees to mentor the next generation of employees.
